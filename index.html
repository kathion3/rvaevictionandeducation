			<p style="color: black, font:monospace">Where a student grows up and their family's income is one of the best predictors of educational outcomes. 
										Learning about the Virginia eviction crisis prompts the question: how could eviction correlate to educational outcomes?
										Little research has been done on the topic, though VCU's Kathryn Howell has explored this relationship with the RVA Eviction Lab [1].
										<br><br>
										Gary Orfield, a professor at UCLA, does research around educational opportunity and asserts that "educational opportunity
										is directly and deeply connected with housing" [2]. With this connection in mind, I decided to investigate the more specific connections
										between eviction and educational opportunities and outcomes. 
										<br><br>
										Virginia is on the front lines of an eviction crisis that most of the public doesn't realize is happening.
										The Commonwealth's laws give power to the landlord tenant-landlord relationships. As a result, several of the top 10 highest
										eviction rates in U.S. cities are in Virginia municipalities. Included in that short list is the City of Richmond, Virginia. 
										<br><br>
										Orfield writes that "racial segregation of neighborhoods in an urban area is a proxy for patterns of educational inequalities in opportunities and outcomes" [3].
										Based on this, and the long history of racial influence on eviction in the forms of redlining, nuisance laws, and tenant screening,
										the focus of this exploration will be race and economic disadvantage as lenses of impact of eviction on educational outcomes in the City of Richmond.

			<p style="font-size: .9em">
				As displayed in the plot to the left, there is a correlation between schools with high 
				proportions of economically disadvantaged student and schools that are accredited with conditions. By mousing over
				the points on the visualization, the eviction rate in the zipcodes in which the schools are located can be explored. 
				<br><br> There is not a clear correlation between schools accredited with conditions and schools with high (>20%) eviction rates. However,
				most of the fully accredited schools do not have high eviction rates. The exception, Patrick Henry School of Science
				and Arts, is a chartered elementary school, and not traditionally zoned.

			<h3 style="color:rgb(203,76,78); font-size:1.4em;">Is race a factor?</h3>
			<p style="font-size: .9em">
				Orfield asserts that housing segregation causes racially segregated schools [5]. 
				People of color are evicted at a disproportionately high rates as a result of discriminatory housing
				policy and economic indequality. These two facts raise the question: where does race fit into this eviction-education relationship?
				<br><br>
				This exploration utilizes the proportion of non-white students of a school, rather than the impact of a high proportion of a specific racial group. 
				This allows us to understand trends of schools with high percentages of students of color to explore the impact of race on school accreditation. 
				Most of the schools accredited with conditions have higher percentages of non-white students. 
				<br><br>
				The schools with lower proportions of non-white students have lower (<20%) eviction rates.
				Given this pattern, there appears to be a relationship between race, eviction rates, and educational outcomes, but needs to be investigated further to establish causation.

			<h3 style="Ã§olor:white">Accreditation & Graduation Trends</h3>
			<p style="color:white">  
				Looking beyond accreditation, we can examine trends related to economic disadvantantage and graduation rates. As shown in the chart below, 
				high proportions of economically disadvantaged students are associated with lower graduation rates and high schools accredited with conditions. 
				<br><br>
				The two fully accredited high schools (Open High and Richmond Community) are alternative high schools. Students are not zoned to these schools. All of the 
				traditional high schools are accredited with conditions. Schools with higher percentages of economically disadvantaged students have lower graduation rates.
				Relatedly, the high schools in zipcodes with higher eviction rates (shown by the size of the bubble in the visualization) have lower graduation rates. For example,
				George Wythe and Huguenot High Schools are both in zipcodes with an eviction rate of 42% and have low graduation rates (81% and 55%, respectively).
				<br><br>
				Residential instability, including the frequent moves and chaos caused by eviction, has been studied and linked to 
				worse educational achievement outcomes, including lower graduation rates [6]. Therefore, the observed trends align with sociological understandings of
				the impact of residential mobility on educational outcomes.

			<h3 style="color:rgb(203,76,78)">Examining Accreditation Status</h3>
			<p>We've examined demographics of schools accredited with conditions and have seen the possible relationship
				with eviction rates in the school's area. But what makes a school fail to be fully accredited? 
				<br><br>"Accredited with conditions," means the school was rated Level Three - "performing below the State Standard" for at least one indicator [7].
				Three of several indicators are Math Achievement Gap, English Achievement Gap, and Chronic Absenteeism.
				<br><br>The visualization below reveals trends of schools of both accreditation statuses. There is clearly a need for improvement in most Richmond schools.

			<h3 style="color: white">Extensions</h3>
			<p style="color: white">This has been just a short exploration of eviction in Richmond City zipcodes and Richmond Public Schools accreditation 
										and demographic data. Including data from more years would be beneficial in understanding overall eviction and education trends.
										<br><br>
										Adding in the context of redlining would likely prove to provide further insight into the effect of historic policies on these trends.
										Redlining was the practice of grading neighborhoods A, B, C, or D according to neighborhood quality (which often stood in for race) 
										to mark which neighborhoods would be eligible to receive federal loans for homeownership [8].
										Redlining is particularly relevant in the current state of neighborhoods and eviction rates as it decided to whom home 
										ownership and opportunity was accessible. In turn, those opportunities have driven school demographics and educational outcomes.
										<br><br>
										To combine eviction and education data for this exploration, schools were associated with the eviction rate of the zipcode in which they are located.
								        However, because school zoning is often somewhat erratic, the immediate
										surrounding area of the school is not necessarily that in which the school's students reside [9]. Thus, a more effective analysis would link
										the eviction rates in a school's zone with that school to examine the relationship between eviction rate and educational outcomes indicators.</p>

			<h3 style="color:rgb(203,76,78);">Conclusion</h3>
			<p style="letter-spacing:normal">
			 No conclusions of causation will be drawn from this exploration of eviction and education data, but there are several striking realizations.
			 <br><br>
			 Relatively few Richmond City public schools meet Virginia state standards for full accreditation. There are more schools accredited with conditions than fully accredited schools.
			 There are no fully accredited middle schools in Richmond. Each of the seven middle schools is performing below the state standard
			 for at least one standard. None of the traditional high schools are fully accredited.
			 <br><br>
			 What does this mean for Richmond public school students? Do their public school educations set them up for success? Likely not, if
			 their schools don't meet state standards. Schools with a high proportion of economically disadvantaged students tend to be accredited with conditions.
			 In the U.S., there is a longheld belief that if you work hard you can get ahead. But if the schools accessible to students are lacking, how does that set them up to "get ahead"?
			 <br><br>
			 Similarly, the housing market is not an equal opportunity playing field. Historic discrimination continues to impact housing opportunities and evictions today.
			 The negative impact of residential mobility - or families who move a lot - on educational outcomes is well documented [6]. 
			 Given the trends of school accreditation and eviction rate seen in this exploration, it seems that high rates of eviction are somehow associated with worse educational outcomes.
			 <br><br>
			 It is clear that work must be put into Richmond schools to improve educational outcomes and maintain full accreditation. 
			 We must find solutions to lower eviction rates in Richmond. The highest eviction rate by zipcode (42% for 23225) is almost 40% higher than the national average, which hovers around 2.5% [10]. 
			 The Richmond average itself is around 22%, far above the national average [11].
			 <br><br>
			 Eviction doesn't just impact the housing market and individuals' lives - it has an impact on the future: children's education drives their future outcomes.
			 Since housing instability negatively impacts those futures, working to decrease eviction rates would pay off in the longterm for the Richmond community.

			<p style="color: black, font:monospace">Where a student grows up and their family's income is one of the best predictors of educational outcomes. 
										So learning about the Virginia eviction crisis prompted the question: how could eviction correlate to educational outcomes?
										<br><br>
										Gary Orfield, a professor at UCLA, does research around educational opportunity and asserts that "educational opportunity
										is directly and deeply connected with housing" [1]. With this connection in mind, I decided to investigate the more specific connections
										between eviction and educational opportunities and outcomes. 
										<br><br>
										Virginia is on the front lines of a little-known about eviction crisis.
										The Commonwealth's laws are set up such that the landlord holds power in the tenant-landlord relationship, so several of the top 10 highest
										eviction rates in U.S. cities are in Virginia municipalities. Included in that short list is the City of Richmond, Virginia. 
										<br><br>
										Orfield writes that "racial segregation of neighborhoods in an urban area is a proxy for patterns of educational inequalities in opportunities and outcomes" [2].
										Based on this, and the long history of racial influence on eviction in the forms of redlining, nuisance laws, and tenant screening,
										I decided to focus on race and economic disadvantage as factors in this investigation of the impact of eviction on educational outcomes in the City of Richmond..

			<h3>Economic Disadvantage</h3>
	
				<p style="font-size:.8em"> A student who is classified as "economically disadvantaged" is "a student who is a member of a household that meets 
					the income eligibility guidelines for free or reduced-price school meals (less than or equal to 185% of Federal 
					Poverty Guidelines) [5]. <br><br>

			<p style="font-size: .9em">
				As you can see in the plot to the left, there is a correlation between schools with high 
				proportions of economically disadvantaged student and schools that are accredited with conditions. By mousing over
				the points on the visualization, you can see the eviction rate in the zipcodes in which the schools are located. 
				<br><br> Although there is not a clear correlation between schools accredited with conditions and schools with high (>20%) eviction rates,
				most of the fully accredited schools do not have high eviction rates - with the exception of Patrick Henry School of Science
				and Arts - which is a chartered elementary school, and not traditionally zoned.

			<h3 style="color:rgb(203,76,78); font-size:1.4em;">Is race a factor?</h3>
			<p style="font-size: .9em">
				Orfield asserts that, as a result of housing segregation, schools are often racially segregated [9]. 
				Additionally, people of color are evicted at a disproportionately high rates as a result of discriminatory housing
				policy and economic indequality. These two facts raise the question: where does race fit into this eviction-education relationship?
				<br><br>
				For the purposes of this exploration, we chose to look at non-white students, rather than data for specific racial groups
				of students of color. This allows us to understand trends of schools with high percentages of students of color. 
				Most of the schools accredited with conditions have higher percentages of non-white students. 
				<br?<br>
				Similarly to above, note that that all of the schools with lower proportions of non-white students have low (<20%) eviction rates.

			<h3 style="çolor:white">Accreditation & Graduation Trends</h3>
			<p style="color:white">  
				Looking beyond simply accrediation, we can examine trends related to economic disadvantantage and graduation rates. As shown in the chart below, 
				high proportions of economically disadvantaged students are associated with lower graduation rates and not schools accredited with conditions. 
				<br><br>
				Note that the fully accredited high schools (Open High and Richmond Community) are alternative high schools - students are not zoned to these schools. All of the 
				traditional high schools are accredited with conditions. Schools with higher percentages of economically disadvantaged students have lower graduation rates.
				Relatedly, the high schools in zipcodes with higher eviction rates (shown by the size of the bubble in the visualization below) have lower graduation rates. 
				<br><br>
				George Wythe and Huguenot High Schools are both in zipcodes with an eviction rate of 42% and have low graduation rates (81% and 55%, respectively).
				Residential instability, including the frequent moves and at-home chaos caused by eviction, has been studied and linked to 
				worse educational achievement outcomes, including lower graduation rates [10].

			<h3 style="color:rgb(203,76,78)">What do fully accredited versus accredited with conditions look like?</h3>
			<p>We've examined demographics of schools accredited with conditions and have seen the possible relationship
				with eviction rates in the school's area. But what makes a school fail to be fully accredited? 
				<br><br>"Accredited with conditions,"
				as explained earlier, means the school was rated Level Three - "performing below the State Standard" [3] for at least one indicator.
				Just three of several of these indicators are Math Achievement Gap, English Achievement Gap, and Chronic Absenteeism. Other indicators
				measure Academic Achievement, which is linked to the Achievement Gap measures. 
				<br><br>In the visualization below, trends of accredited conditions 
				schools are revealed - and we see why some of them fail to be accredited - any school that is given the Level Three rating will not be fully accredited.

			<h3 style="color: white">Extensions</h3>
			<p style="color: white">This has been just a short exploration of eviction in Richmond City zipcodes and Richmond Public Schools accreditation 
										and demographic data. Including data from more years would be beneficial in understanding overall eviction and education trends.
										<br><br>
										Visualizing eviction trends and achievement gap level trends with line charts would be effective in visualizing temporal data. 
										Additionally, combining eviction and school quality data and visualizing links between eviction rates in a school zone and 
										chronic absenteeism and graduation rates in those schools would allow us to examine in detail these patterns.
										<br><br>
										 Further, adding in the context of redlining would likely prove to provide a new layer to the analysis.
										Redlining was the practice of grading neighborhoods A, B, C, or D according to neighborhood quality (which often stood in for race) 
										to mark which neighborhoods would be eligible to receive federal loans for homeownership [6].
										Hence, redlining is particularly relevant in the current state of neighborhoods and eviction rates as it decided to whom home 
										ownership and opportunity was accessible.
										<br><br>
										To combine eviction and education data for this exploration, I associated the eviction rate of the zipcode in which the school is located
										with the school. However, because school zoning is often somewhat erratic, in part to hoard opportunities for privileged students, the immediate
										surrounding area of the school is not necessarily that in which the school's students reside [7]. Thus, a more effective analysis would link
										the eviction rates in a school's zone with that school to examine the relationship between eviction rate and educational outcomes indicators.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p style="letter-spacing:normal">
			 No conclusions of causation will be drawn from this exploration of eviction and education data, but there are several striking realizations to recognize.
			 <br><br>
			 Relatively few Richmond City public schools meet Virginia state standards for full accreditation. There are more schools accredited with conditions than fully accredited schools.
			 There are no fully accredited middle schools in Richmond. Each of the seven middle schools is performing below the state standard
			 for at least one standard. None of the traditional high schools, to which City students are zoned, are fully accredited.
			 <br><br>
			 What does this mean for Richmond public school students? Do their public school educations set them up for success? Likely not, if
			 their schools don't meet state standards. Schools with a high proportion of economically disadvantaged students tend to be accredited with conditions.
			 In the U.S., there is a longheld belief that if you work hard you can get ahead. But if the schools accessible to students are lacking, how does that set them up to "get ahead"?
			 <br><br>
			 Similarly, the housing market is not an equal opportunity playing field. Historic discrimination continues to impact housing opportunities and evictions today.
			 The negative impact of residential mobility - or families who move a lot - on educational outcomes is well documented [10]. 
			 Given the trends of school accreditation and eviction rate seen in this exploration, it seems that high rates of eviction are somehow associated with worse educational outcomes.
			 <br><br>
			 It is clear that work must be put into Richmond schools to improve educational outcomes and maintain full accreditation. 
			 We must find solutions to lower eviction rates in Richmond - 42%, the evicton rate for the 23225 zipcode, is almost 40% higher than the national average, which hovers around 2.5%. 
			 Eviction doesn't just impact the housing market and individuals' lives - it has an impact on the future: children's education drives their future outcomes.
			 Since housing instability negatively impacts those futures, working to decrease eviction rates would pay off in the longterm for the Richmond community.

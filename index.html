<!--
	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<p style="color: white">We move places where our kids can go to good schools. 
					But what feeds into what a good school looks like? In this exploration of Richmond Schools data, coupled with eviction data, we look at what a "good school" might look like in Richmond City, Virginia. 
					Sometimes there's a sentiment of, "well that's not my Richmond" or "yeah it's like that, but I live in x neighborhood" - but eviction and education impact everyone, whether they know it or not.

				"Accredited with conditions" indicates that a school has been rated below-state-level performance in one or more category under Virginia accreditation standards.
				This means at least one standard was rated at Level Three which means the school is performing below the state standard for that indicator.
				Such indicators include academic achievement in Math, English, and Science, achievement gaps in Math and English, and Chronic Absenteeism (missing 15+ days in a school year).

			<p style="color: white">This has been just a short exploration of eviction in Richmond City zipcodes and Richmond Public Schools accreditation </p>
			<p style="color: white">and demogrpahic data. Including data from more years would be beneficial in understanding overall eviction and education trends. </p>
			<p style = "color: white">Visualizing eviction trends and achievement gap level trends with line charts would be effective in visualizing temporal data. 
										Additionally, combining eviction and school quality data and visualizing links between eviction rates in a school zone and 
										chronic absenteeism and graduation rates in those schools would allow us to examine in detail these patterns.
										<br> Further, adding in the context of redlining would likely prove to provide a new layer to the analysis.
										Redlining was the practice of grading neighborhoods A, B, C, or D according to neighborhood quality (which often stood in for race) 
										to mark which neighborhoods would be eligible to receive federal loans for homeownership.
										Hence, redlining is particularly relevant in the current state of neighborhoods and eviction rates as it decided to whom home 
										ownership and opportunity was accessible.</p>
